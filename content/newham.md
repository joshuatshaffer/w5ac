{{< qna "What can I do with the Technician amateur radio license?" >}}
The Technician license allows you to operate an amateur radio station on all amateur radio frequencies above 30 MHz (and a few select frequencies below). The Technician frequency privileges include the popular 2 meter band where most local and area communication occurs. An amateur with the Technician license can use voice repeaters using a mobile or hand-held radio to communication with other hams in the area or around the world via internet connections or amateur radio satellites. Many hams use their technician license to participate as severe weather storm spotters or to provide emergency communications support.
