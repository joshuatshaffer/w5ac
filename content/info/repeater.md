146.82 Repeater

W5AC's main repeater transmits on 146.820 MHz and receives on 146.220 MHz. Look here for frequently asked questions about repeaters.

The repeater requires a subaudible tone of 88.5 Hz. Tone must always be transmitted at this time. The repeater also encodes a tone of 88.5 Hz (in place due to proximity to another repeater).

The repeater radio is a GE Mastr II Executive, with Wacom duplexers and a 30 amp Astron power supply. The controller is an ACC RC-85. It is located on the 14th floor of the O&M Building, on TAMU Main Campus. Click here for pictures. The antenna is a Hustler model G6-270R dual-band antenna, on the roof. This gives a height above ground around 160 feet. The repeater radio puts out 40 watts and has about a 30 mile range with a 50-watt mobile or about 5-7 miles with an HT and a "rubber duck" antenna. There is currently no emergency power capability. The repeater and autopatch are "open" for use by any amateur radio operator.

Joe, N5PYK, has generated a repeater coverage based on a 50W mobile rig. Empirical test suggest that this is pretty close to the actual coverage. Click on the map to open a larger version.

It very closely approximates where a 50W mobile can get into the repeater (assuming 5/8 wave antenna).

Blue areas are going to be fairly scratchy in a mobile environment Pale green (-110) areas will have some white noise and fluttering Medium green (-106) and "hotter" colors will pretty much be full quieting.

One can estimate outside handheld coverage by the areas of GREEN. Note that this represents dead-band coverage. When there is a band opening, usually due to atmostpheric events, coverage will be even greater.
