Membership in W5AC is open to anyone interested in **amateur radio** at TAMU. We welcome undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty and staff, and community members!

Becoming a member entitles you access to our shack, which includes a wide range of radio and electronic equipment. Learn from fellow club members how to use these tools, without having to purchase them all yourself. Hams don't just talk on the radio - they've also been known to work on antenna towers, build their own parts, and much more.

The easiest way to join is to attend our meetings. You are a member of W5AC once you agree to the club bylaws and operating rules, and pay dues to an officer (usually the Treasurer). Dues for the academic year are:

 * $25.00 for voting members or
 * $20.00 for non-voting members.

Prorated membership is also available. See the Constitution for the current prorated membership.

For more information about the club or about ham radio, peruse our links or feel free to contact the club officers - [Contact us page]({{< relref "contact.md" >}}).
